#SquareRobin - Simple Lead Distribution

You have leads coming in, and you need to distribute them to your affiliate partners / call center team / whatever. SquareRobin can help! 

This Django-based project takes in leads via form entry or POST request to an API endpoint, then distributes those leads according to automation rules defined by the user. Leads can be distributed via POST and/or email to an arbitrary number of recipients. Email automation is designed to work out-of-the-box with a free SendGrid account.
